gradle-mvn-push
===============

See this blog post for more context on this 'library': [http://chris.banes.me/2013/08/27/pushing-aars-to-maven-central/](http://chris.banes.me/2013/08/27/pushing-aars-to-maven-central/).


## Usage

### 1. Have a working Gradle build
This is upto you.

### 2. Update your home gradle.properties

This will include the username and password to upload to the Maven server and so that they are kept local on your machine. The location defaults to `USER_HOME/.gradle/gradle.properties`.

It may also include your signing key id, password, and secret key ring file (for signed uploads).  Signing is only necessary if you're putting release builds of your project on maven central.

```
NEXUS_USERNAME=chrisbanes
NEXUS_PASSWORD=g00dtry

signing.keyId=ABCDEF12
signing.password=n1c3try
signing.secretKeyRingFile=~/.gnupg/secring.gpg
```

### 3. Create project root gradle.properties
You may already have this file, in which case just edit the original. This file should contain the POM values which are common to all of your sub-project (if you have any). For instance, here's [ActionBar-PullToRefresh's](https://github.com/chrisbanes/ActionBar-PullToRefresh):

```
VERSION_NAME=0.9.2-SNAPSHOT
VERSION_CODE=92
GROUP=com.github.chrisbanes.actionbarpulltorefresh

POM_DESCRIPTION=A modern implementation of the pull-to-refresh for Android
POM_URL=https://github.com/chrisbanes/ActionBar-PullToRefresh
POM_SCM_URL=https://github.com/chrisbanes/ActionBar-PullToRefresh
POM_SCM_CONNECTION=scm:git@github.com:chrisbanes/ActionBar-PullToRefresh.git
POM_SCM_DEV_CONNECTION=scm:git@github.com:chrisbanes/ActionBar-PullToRefresh.git
POM_LICENCE_NAME=The Apache Software License, Version 2.0
POM_LICENCE_URL=http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt
POM_LICENCE_DIST=repo
POM_DEVELOPER_ID=chrisbanes
POM_DEVELOPER_NAME=Chris Banes
```

The `VERSION_NAME` value is important. If it contains the keyword `SNAPSHOT` then the build will upload to the snapshot server, if not then to the release server.

### 4. Create gradle.properties in each sub-project
The values in this file are specific to the sub-project (and override those in the root `gradle.properties`). In this example, this is just the name, artifactId and packaging type:

```
POM_NAME=ActionBar-PullToRefresh Library
POM_ARTIFACT_ID=library
POM_PACKAGING=aar
```

### 5. Call the script from each sub-modules build.gradle

Add the following at the end of each `build.gradle` that you wish to upload:

	apply from: 'https://raw.github.com/chrisbanes/gradle-mvn-push/master/gradle-mvn-push.gradle'

### 6. Build and Push

You can now build and push:

	gradle clean build uploadArchives
	
### Other Properties

There are other properties which can be set:

```
RELEASE_REPOSITORY_URL (defaults to Maven Central's staging server)
SNAPSHOT_REPOSITORY_URL (defaults to Maven Central's snapshot server)
```
